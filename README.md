A simple hack of `musicInfo.drp`, actually a DRP codec, originally inspired by
and grabbed from [this cool mysterious gist](https://gist.github.com/dantarion/c84e7ae618c18cb735342156e6bc8849).
In short, DRP is a binary file format that uses [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) to
compress XML data and store the filenames and their checksums.

What And Why
------------

Once I got a DRP file from my friend and was told that it was taken from WiiU
console game, [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin),
which might store the list of the soundtrack info and the player's profile,
something he wanted to hack for fun. And he found a thread that said it was a
binary XML file. I casually searched on the web and got the gist shown above,
and wanted to implement a compressor for practicing.
